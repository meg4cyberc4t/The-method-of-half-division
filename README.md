Метод половинного деления (Домашняя работа по высшей математике)

The method of half division (Homework in higher mathematics)

Important points

When you type f(x), don't forget the spaces around each x. If the code does not work correctly, check the formula.
There will always be no perfectly clear digit (divide and conquer on float works until it reaches the limit of numbers after floating point). Sometimes you will have to round it up, because the method works up to the typing limit.
